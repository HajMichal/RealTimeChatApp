Deployed app is not working because I can't find good and free hosting for my backend side.
You can install it localy or watch workflow below.

What you can do in my chatApp:
* create new account or log into an existing one.
* invite your friends
* start chatting with your friends
* remove friend from friends list

## üìù Description

Developed a Real-Time Chat Application that instant messaging with user-friendly interface. This project challenged me with implementing Websockets for real-time communication. I utilized Mantine and DaisyUI components for an engaging frontend, while the backend relied on Express with Prisma for data management. The frontend was built using React with React Query for efficient data handling. This project showcases my ability to work with modern web technologies and handle complex challenges, particularly in the realm of real-time communication.
